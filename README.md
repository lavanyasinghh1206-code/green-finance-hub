ReServe- FROM WASTE TO WONDER
Why ReServe Matters?

Having personally witnessed the large amount of freshly prepared food being wasted daily in our hostel mess, our team was motivated to address this issue. This observation led us to conceptualize ReServe as a practical solution to reduce food wastage while making meals more accessible to students

From extra food to extra impact ReServe is a simple platform for hostel messes to list surplus food before it goes to waste.
·       The mess staff can update what food is available, quantity, price and pickup time.
·       The person in need can check the app, reserve the food, and collect it before closing time.
·       The app also shows how much food has been saved and the environmental impact, like meals saved and waste reduced. Less waste, more meals, real impact.
 

What does ReServe stand for?

ReServe stands for “Re-Serving food” a platform designed to reduce food wastage by giving surplus mess meals a second chance. It enables mess operators to list excess freshly prepared food in real time, while students can reserve and collect these meals at affordable prices within a short pickup window, promoting sustainability and accessibility on campus.
